The SBC shows you how you and the plan \nwould share the cost for covered health care services. NOTE: Information about the cost of this plan (called the premium) will be provided \nseparately. This is only a summary. For more information about your coverage, or to get a copy of the complete terms of coverage, [insert contact \ninformation]. For general definitions of common terms, such as allowed amount, balance billing, coinsurance, copayment, deductible, provider, or other underlined \nterms, see the Glossary. You can view the Glossary at www.[insert].com or call 1-800-[insert] to request a copy. \nImportant Questions \nAnswers \nWhy This Matters: \nWhat is the overall \ndeductible? \n$500 / individual or $1,000 / family \nGenerally, you must pay all of the costs from providers up to the deductible amount before this \nplan begins to pay. If you have other family members on the plan, each family member must \nmeet their own individual deductible until the total amount of deductible expenses paid by all \nfamily members meets the overall family deductible. \nAre there services \ncovered before you meet \nyour deductible? \nYes. Preventive care and primary \ncare services are covered before \nyou meet your deductible. \nThis plan covers some items and services even if you haven\u2019t yet met the deductible amount. \nBut a copayment or coinsurance may apply. For example, this plan covers certain preventive \nservices without cost sharing and before you meet your deductible. See a list of covered \npreventive services at https://www.healthcare.gov/coverage/preventive-care-benefits/. \nAre there other \ndeductibles for specific \nservices? \nYes. $300 for prescription drug \ncoverage and $300 for",
